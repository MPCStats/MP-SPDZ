This Folder is Used for validating ideas/necessary properties for our application for DevCon.

The computation function in this demo is the same as bankers_bonus aka determine the highest bonus value

**Current Property that this demo supports**

- Client can log in to just provide input and log out
- Same client can log in and update their value (does this make sense?)
- Anyone can log in to get output (some predetermined supported function)
- Server can store file of inputs as secret shared among them. and can read from those files.
- Our info (secret shared) of prev inputs are sustained. client_values = [45, 50, 60, …. , ]
  - If new computation are required, just run a new computation function, while downloading the saved shared

**Limitation/Constraints/ Design to consider**

- Now we set up for each client certificate beforehand —> we need to implement following feature for our edge application (browser or application?)
  - To index their client_ID properly, not skipping the order into the server (like server won’t receive input from client#3 before client#2. This assumption is required for determine_winner function (not loop MAX client since that’ll be too expensive)
  - Make sure there won’t be duplicate client_id across different devices
- Need to limit max client.. —> array size predetermined… [, , , , , , ]
- Still 1 way demo aka
  - Initiate the server, then take some inputs from multiple parties until a certain client (In example is client#0) tells us to save the private inputs across computation servers
  - Then, we can initiate the server again to download prev saved inputs, and continue
  - Now, we can’t reboot it again, because that requires us to delete the previous saved one to overwrite it
    - we cannot just extend the result, since we can update the previous value —> or we can just keep remembering the location of newest patch and keep extending
    - Or we need to be able to delete the previous saved one, to just write a completely new one
  - Note that we decide to write_to_file as Array instead of sint, due to easier management, but things can change if deemed appropriate.
- Can we save at other location?, now write_to_file & read_from_file only looks at one location. For now, we can solve this issue by remembering the location of each data. Since it just keeps appending and such anyway.
- What if updating the computation all the time—> leak every update —> use update modulo, maybe update every 10 number of clients?
- We never have connected clients that can always just broadcast —> I think this design makes sense.
- So need to have interval that the edge ping for output (maybe modulo thingy mentioned earlier
- Now in demo-client-from-file, we hardcode number_clients as 2 —> in reality, just read from some place since it’s public anyway.

Note: Data structure that support read_from_file, write_to_file stuffs, aka saving and reading for computation server

Array, Matrix, multiArray, sfix, sint, Compiler.ml.FixAveragePool2d, Compiler.ml.FixConv2d

**Main Files Involved**

- ExternalDemo/demo-client.py for client providing input
- ExternalDemo/demo-client-output.py for client requesting output
- Programs/Source/demo-client.mpc for running mpc & save by secret shared the private inputs
- Programs/Source/demo-client-from-file.mpc for re-running mpc & read from secret shared file

**Test Flow**

1. Initiate the server for the first time

   ```
   Scripts/setup-ssl.sh <nparties>
   Scripts/setup-clients.sh <nclients>
   ./compile.py demo-client
   PLAYERS=<nparties> Scripts/<protocol>.sh demo-client
   ```

2. Let clients interact

   2.1 For those wanting to provide input (with key 1), Note that my our assumption, client must provide input value ordered by client_id aka client#0 should provide input before client#1

   ```
   python3 ExternalDemo/demo-client.py <client_id> <nparties> 1 <value>
   ```

   2.2 For those wanting to request output (with key 0), note that anyone can come in to request output at anytime. You can alternate things like client#0 provides input, then someone requests output, then client#1 provides input, then client#0 update input, then someone requests output, and so on, you get the idea.

   ```
   python3 ExternalDemo/demo-client-output.py <client_id> <nparties> 0
   ```

   2.3 For admin (client#0) to tell this mpc running servers to save the secret-shared of those inputs they have and crash. (client#0 and key 99)

   ```
   python3 ExternalDemo/demo-client-output.py 0 <nparties> 99
   ```

3. Re-start the mpc servers, retrieve previously saved secret-shared inputs, and keep running.

   3.1 Restart the mpc servers

   ```
   ./compile.py demo-client-from-file
   PLAYERS=<nparties> Scripts/<protocol>.sh demo-client-from-file
   ```

   3.2 Now the clients can interact as 2.1 and 2.2 (Yet no way to save and crash this running, due to the reason mentioned above in Limitation/constraints section)

**Legacy from Originial ReadMe**

The ExternalIO directory contains an example of managing I/O between
external client processes and parties running MP-SPDZ engines. These
instructions assume that MP-SPDZ has been built as per the [project
readme](../README.md).

## Working Examples

[bankers-bonus-client.cpp](../ExternalIO/bankers-bonus-client.cpp) and
[bankers-bonus-client.py](../ExternalIO/bankers-bonus-client.py) act as a
client to [bankers_bonus.mpc](../Programs/Source/bankers_bonus.mpc)
and demonstrates sending input and receiving output as described by
[Damgård et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1006) The computation
allows up to eight clients to input a number and computes the client
with the largest input. You can run the C++ code as follows from the main
directory:

```
make bankers-bonus-client.x
./compile.py bankers_bonus 1
Scripts/setup-ssl.sh <nparties>
Scripts/setup-clients.sh 3
PLAYERS=<nparties> Scripts/<protocol>.sh bankers_bonus-1 &
./bankers-bonus-client.x 0 <nparties> 100 0 &
./bankers-bonus-client.x 1 <nparties> 200 0 &
./bankers-bonus-client.x 2 <nparties> 50 1
```

`<protocol>` can be any arithmetic protocol (e.g., `mascot`) but not a
binary protocol (e.g., `yao`).
This should output that the winning id is 1. Note that the ids have to
be incremental, and the client with the highest id has to input 1 as
the last argument while the others have to input 0 there. Furthermore,
`<nparties>` refers to the number of parties running the computation
not the number of clients, and `<protocol>` can be the name of
protocol script. The setup scripts generate the necessary SSL
certificates and keys. Therefore, if you run the computation on
different hosts, you will have to distribute the `*.pem` files.

For the Python client, make sure to install
[gmpy2](https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2), and run
`ExternalIO/bankers-bonus-client.py` instead of
`bankers-bonus-client.x`.

## I/O MPC Instructions

### Connection Setup

1. [Listen for clients](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiler.html#Compiler.library.listen_for_clients)
2. [Accept client connections](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiler.html#Compiler.library.accept_client_connection)
3. [Close client connections](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instructions.html#Compiler.instructions.closeclientconnection)

### Data Exchange

Only the `sint` methods used in the example are documented here, equivalent methods are available for other data types. See [the reference](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiler.html#module-Compiler.types).

1. [Public value from client](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiler.html#Compiler.types.regint.read_from_socket)
2. [Secret value from client](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiler.html#Compiler.types.sint.receive_from_client)
3. [Reveal secret value to clients](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Compiler.html#Compiler.types.sint.reveal_to_clients)

## Client-Side Interface

The example uses the `Client` class implemented in
`ExternalIO/Client.hpp` to handle the communication, see
[this reference](https://mp-spdz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/io.html#reference) for
documentation.
